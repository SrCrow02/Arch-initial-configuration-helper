# Arch Inital Configuration and Maintenance

I did this project just to help me with instalation and maintenance of my arch and so on, but feel free to use it as you wish.

## How to use
```git
git clone https://github.com/SrCrow02/Arch-initial-configuration-helper
```

```shell 
chmod +x dev_init.sh
./dev_init.sh
```

## arch_init
The code will require you to type some informations and start the init with several configurations, download important things like firewall and enable it.

## maintain_arch
This is a daily script for the security and health of your system, do it always.
